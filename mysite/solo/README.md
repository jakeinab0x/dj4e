This app is part of the solo app creation assignment of the DJ4E course:
https://chucklist.dj4e.com/solo/

Here's the assignment spec:
-This application takes two input fields, trims off any extra spaces from the beginning and end of the values.
-Then it concatenates the fields together with a space in between them.
-Then call the upper() method on the string and display it as the result.
